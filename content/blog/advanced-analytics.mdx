Understanding your link performance is crucial for making data-driven decisions. Badget's advanced analytics provide deep insights into how your links are performing across different dimensions.

Monitor your CTR to understand engagement levels:

```typescript
interface ClickThroughRate {
  totalClicks: number;

  ctr: number; // clicks / impressions * 100
}

const calculateCTR = (clicks: number, impressions: number): number => {
  return impressions > 0 ? (clicks / impressions) * 100 : 0;
};
```
