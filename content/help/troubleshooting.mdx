# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide covers solutions to the most frequently encountered issues with Badget.

## Link Creation Issues

### "Invalid URL" Error

**Problem**: Getting an error when trying to create a short link.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your URL includes `http://` or `https://`
2. Check for typos in the URL
3. Verify the destination website is accessible
4. Remove any special characters that might cause issues

**Example**:
```
❌ Wrong: example.com
✅ Correct: https://example.com
```

### Alias Already Taken

**Problem**: Custom alias you want is already in use.

**Solutions**:
1. Try a different alias variation
2. Add numbers or descriptive words
3. Use your brand name as a prefix
4. Check if you already created this alias previously

### Link Not Redirecting

**Problem**: Short link isn't redirecting to the intended destination.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the original URL is still valid
2. Verify the link hasn't expired
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try opening in an incognito/private window
5. Check if the link has been disabled

## Analytics and Tracking

### Missing Click Data

**Problem**: Analytics showing zero clicks despite traffic.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify tracking is enabled for the link
2. Check if you're testing with the same IP repeatedly
3. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browsers
4. Look for bot traffic filtering settings
5. Check the time range in your analytics view

### Incorrect Geographic Data

**Problem**: Location data seems inaccurate.

**Explanation**: Geographic data is based on IP addresses, which can be:
- VPN or proxy servers
- Corporate networks
- Mobile carrier locations
- CDN endpoints

**Note**: This is a limitation of IP-based geolocation, not a bug.

### Analytics Delays

**Problem**: Click data not appearing immediately.

**Normal Behavior**: Analytics may take 5-15 minutes to update due to:
- Data processing pipelines
- Cache invalidation
- Real-time vs. batch processing

## Custom Domain Issues

### Domain Not Verifying

**Problem**: Custom domain verification failing.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check DNS Records**:
   ```bash
   # Check CNAME record
   dig your-domain.com CNAME
   
   # Check A record
   dig your-domain.com A
   ```

2. **Common DNS Issues**:
   - TTL too high (should be 3600 or lower)
   - Incorrect record values
   - DNS propagation delays (up to 24 hours)
   - Cloudflare proxy enabled (should be DNS only)

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Subdomain: `CNAME short -> cname.badget.app`
   - Root domain: `A @ -> 76.76.19.123`

### SSL Certificate Problems

**Problem**: SSL certificate not provisioning.

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 15-30 minutes after domain verification
2. Ensure domain is publicly accessible
3. Check for conflicting SSL certificates
4. Contact support if issues persist beyond 1 hour

## API Integration Issues

### Authentication Errors

**Problem**: Getting 401 Unauthorized responses.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check API Key Format**:
   ```bash
   # Correct format
   Authorization: Bearer bdg_1234567890abcdef
   ```

2. **Common Mistakes**:
   - Missing "Bearer " prefix
   - Extra spaces in the header
   - Using test key in production
   - Expired or revoked key

3. **Generate New Key**:
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Click "Generate New Key"
   - Update your applications

### Rate Limiting

**Problem**: Getting 429 Too Many Requests errors.

**Understanding Rate Limits**:
- Free: 1,000 requests/hour
- Pro: 10,000 requests/hour
- Enterprise: Custom limits

**Solutions**:
1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Cache responses when possible
3. Upgrade to higher plan
4. Contact support for higher limits

### API Response Errors

**Problem**: Unexpected API responses or errors.

**Debugging Steps**:
1. **Check Request Format**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.badget.app/links \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
   ```

2. **Validate JSON Syntax**
3. **Check Required Fields**
4. **Review API Documentation**
