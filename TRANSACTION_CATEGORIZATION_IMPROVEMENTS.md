## Implementation Plan

### Current System Analysis

The existing system has:
- Transaction statuses: RECONCILED, NEEDS_CATEGORIZATION, NEEDS_REVIEW, IN_PROGRESS
- InteractiveTransactionBadge handles category selection for NEEDS_CATEGORIZATION and NEEDS_REVIEW
- Quick filters include an "Uncategorized" tab that filters by NEEDS_CATEGORIZATION status
- updateTransactionCategory action automatically sets status to RECONCILED when category is assigned

### Required Changes

1. **Enhanced Uncategorized Detection**
   - Create a new filter logic that identifies transactions without categories regardless of status
   - Add "Uncategorized" as a special filter that combines multiple conditions
   - Include RECONCILED transactions that somehow lost their category

2. **Mandatory Category for Reconciled Transactions**
   - Modify the transaction display logic to show category selection for RECONCILED transactions without categories
   - Add validation to prevent transactions from being marked as RECONCILED without a category
   - Update InteractiveTransactionBadge to handle this new state

3. **Improved Filter System**
   - Add "Uncategorized" as a special filter option
   - Enhance quick filters to show count of uncategorized transactions
   - Create visual indicators for different types of uncategorized transactions

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Query Updates
- Modify getAllTransactions to support "uncategorized" filter
- Add compound WHERE clause: `categoryId IS NULL OR categoryId = ''`
- Ensure proper indexing for performance

#### Component Updates
- Extend FilterValues type to include "uncategorized" boolean
- Update TransactionFilterWrapper to handle uncategorized filter
- Modify InteractiveTransactionBadge to show category selection for RECONCILED+uncategorized

#### UI/UX Improvements
- Add visual distinction between different uncategorized states
- Implement batch categorization for multiple transactions
- Add category suggestions based on transaction patterns

### Data Flow

```
Transaction → Check Category Status → Display Appropriate UI
├── Has Category + RECONCILED → Show category badge
├── No Category + NEEDS_CATEGORIZATION → Show category selector
├── No Category + NEEDS_REVIEW → Show category selector
└── No Category + RECONCILED → Show category selector (NEW)
```

### Environment Configuration

No additional environment configuration required for basic implementation.

### Testing Considerations

- Test uncategorized filter with various transaction states
- Verify category selection works for all transaction statuses
- Test bulk operations performance with large datasets
- Validate that RECONCILED transactions cannot exist without categories

### Performance Considerations

- Add database indexes for categoryId IS NULL queries
- Implement pagination for uncategorized transactions
- Consider caching for frequently accessed category data
- Optimize bulk update operations
