# AI Budget Testing Feature Implementation

A comprehensive testing interface for AI-powered budgeting functions that allows users to test budget recommendations, anomaly detection, spending forecasts, and custom AI queries.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up AI budget actions with server-side functions
- [x] Create basic test page at `/dashboard/ai-test`
- [x] Implement client-side component with button triggers
- [x] Add console logging for debugging (both client and server side)
- [x] Fix text visibility issues with proper contrast
- [x] Redesign UI using border-based styling (matching `/open` page)
- [x] Implement 2x2 grid layout for main functions
- [x] Add color-coded icons for different function types
- [x] Fix budget calculation bug (negative values to positive budgets)

## In Progress Tasks

(No current tasks in progress)

## Completed Tasks (Continued)

- [x] Add tabbed interface for results display (User-friendly vs JSON debug)
- [x] Enhance result formatting for better user experience
- [x] Create specialized formatters for each result type
- [x] Implement user-friendly budget recommendation display
- [x] Implement user-friendly anomaly detection display
- [x] Implement user-friendly forecast display
- [x] Add proper icons and visual hierarchy to tabs

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add result export functionality
- [ ] Implement result comparison between different time periods
- [ ] Add data visualization for budget recommendations
- [ ] Create preset question templates for finance Q&A
- [ ] Add rate limiting for AI API calls
- [ ] Implement result caching to avoid duplicate API calls

## Implementation Plan

The AI Budget Testing feature provides a comprehensive interface for testing all AI-powered budgeting functions with real user data.

### Key Features
- **Budget Recommendations**: Generate AI-powered budget suggestions based on spending history
- **Transaction Anomalies**: Detect unusual spending patterns that need attention
- **Spending Forecasts**: Predict future spending using trend analysis
- **Finance Q&A**: Ask natural language questions about finances
- **Budget Tips**: Get personalized money-saving advice
- **Custom AI Prompts**: Run any custom prompts through the AI

### Relevant Files

- `src/actions/ai-budget-actions.ts` - âœ… Core AI budget functions with OpenAI integration
- `src/app/dashboard/ai-test/page.tsx` - âœ… Server component that renders the test page
- `src/components/ai-test-client.tsx` - âœ… Client component with interactive UI and state management
- `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` - ðŸ”„ Will be used for result display tabs

### Technical Implementation

**Server Actions** (`ai-budget-actions.ts`):
- `generateBudgetRecommendations()` - Analyzes spending patterns and creates budget suggestions
- `detectTransactionAnomalies()` - Uses statistical analysis to find unusual transactions
- `forecastCategorySpending()` - Linear regression for spending predictions
- `answerFinanceQuestion()` - Natural language Q&A with transaction context
- `generateBudgetTips()` - Personalized money-saving advice
- `runAiPrompt()` - General purpose AI interaction

**Client Interface** (`ai-test-client.tsx`):
- 2x2 grid layout for main functions
- Interactive forms for questions and prompts
- Real-time loading states and error handling
- Console logging for debugging
- Responsive design with proper contrast

**Data Flow**:
1. User clicks test button â†’ Client calls server action
2. Server action queries Prisma database for user's financial data
3. Server action calls OpenAI API with context and prompts
4. Results returned to client and displayed in formatted interface
5. Both user-friendly and JSON debug views available

### Environment Requirements
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for AI functionality
- Authenticated user with family membership
- Transaction data in database for meaningful results
