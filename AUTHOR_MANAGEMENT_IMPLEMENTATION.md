## Future Tasks

- [ ] Consider adding author profile pages
- [ ] Update documentation for content creators

## Implementation Plan - COMPLETED ✅

The simplified author management system now provides:

1. **Simple Author References**: Just `author: "christerhagen"` in frontmatter
2. **Centralized Author Data**: All author details defined in `src/data/authors.ts`
3. **Automatic Resolution**: Content collections automatically resolve author data
4. **Custom Titles**: Each author has a default title but can be customized per post
5. **Rich Author Info**: Support for bio, social links, and profile images

### Usage Example

```yaml
---
title: "My Blog Post"
description: "A great blog post"
publishedAt: "2024-01-22"
author: "christerhagen"  # That's it! All author details come from authors.ts
tags: ["example"]
---
```
